The Rise and Fall of an Unix Epoch V1.2



DESCRIPTION
-=========-
This is a table representing the time between the development of Unix and its appropriation for commercial uses. 

Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, whose development started in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. Unix is the matrix of many tools/OS/devices used by commercial companies nowadays.

This page calculates time thanks to a JavaScript method (getTime()). This method works using Unix Time, a system for describing a point in time firstly implemented in the early versions of Unix.
